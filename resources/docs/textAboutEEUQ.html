This is the Earthquake Engineering with Uncertainty Quantification (EE-UQ) application.
</h1>
<p>
This open-source research application, https://github.com/NHERI-SimCenter/EE-UQ, provides an application
researchers can use to predict the response of a building to earthquake events. The application is focused on
quantifying the uncertainties in the predicted response, given the that the properties of the buildings and the earthquake
events are not known exactly, and that the simulation software and the user make simplifying assumptions in the numerical
modeling of that structure. In the application the user is required to characterize the uncertainties in the input, the
application will after utilizing the selected sampling method, provide information that characterizes the uncertainties in
the response. The computations to make these determinations can be prohibitively expensive. To overcome this impedement the
user has the option to perform the computations on the Stampede2 supercomputer. Stampede2 is located at the Texas Advanced
Computing Center and is made available to the user through NHERI DesignSafe, the cyberinfrastructure provider for the distributed
NSF funded Natural Hazards in Engineering Research Infrastructure, NHERI, facility.
<p>
The computations are performed in a workflow application. That is, the numerical simulations are actually performed by a
number of different applications. The EE-UQ backend software runs these different applications for the user, taking the
outputs from some programs and providing them as inputs to others. The design of the EE-UQ application is such that
researchers are able to modify the backend application to utilize their own application in the workflow computations.
This will ensure researchers are not limited to using the default applications we provide and will be enthused to provide
their own applications for others to use.
<p>
  Researchers are encouraged to comment on what additional features and applications they would like to see in this application. If you want it, chances are many of your colleagues also would benefit from it. Additional requests should be posted at the <a href="https://simcenter-messageboard.designsafe-ci.org/smf/index.php?board=6.0"> SimCenter forum</a>.
