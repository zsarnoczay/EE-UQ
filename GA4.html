    <h1> This is the Earthquake Engineering with Uncertainty Quantification (EE-UQ) application.</h1>

    <p>This open-source research application, https://github.com/NHERI-SimCenter/EE-UQ, provides an application
       researchers can use to predict the response of a building to earthquake events. The application is focused on
       quantifying the uncertainties in the predicted response, given the that the properties of the buildings and the earthquake
       events are not known exactly, and that the simulation software and the user make simplifying assumptions in the numerical
       modeling of that structure. In the application the user is required to characterize the uncertainties in the input, the
       application will after utilizing the selected sampling method, provide information that characterizes the uncertainties in
       the response.
